# UnityScript to C# converter

The same thing as the [C# to UnityScript converter](https://github.com/florentpoujol/CSharpToUnityScriptConverter), but in the other way.

As UnityScript is more flexible and less verbose, doing the convertion this way is harder and has many more cases to be taken car of.

I don't remember now (2016) up to which point I worked on it but it definitely wasn't finished...
